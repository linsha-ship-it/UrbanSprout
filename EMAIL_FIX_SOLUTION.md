# Email Configuration Fix for UrbanSprout

## 🚨 Issue Identified
The email sending functionality is failing because the Gmail authentication credentials are not properly configured. The error shows:
```
535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted
```

## 🔧 Solution Steps

### 1. Gmail App Password Setup
To fix this issue, you need to set up a Gmail App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character password

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Update your `.env` file with the correct credentials:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-actual-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
```

### 3. Test Email Functionality
Run the test script to verify the fix:

```bash
cd server
node test-blog-rejection-email.js
```

### Option 1: SendGrid (Recommended for Production)
